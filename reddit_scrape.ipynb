I’ve been like this (your gf) in my most recent relationship (who has recently broken up) and i can’t imagine how exhausting that is, I’m sorry you have to go through that :( I’d suggest maybe (if you haven’t already) communicating how upsetting you find these lashouts to be, and that you feel upset she never asks about how you feel on things? but also don’t feel you have to stay in this relationship, it could eventually lead to resentment and may end up in a real lash out on your end, or may cause your mental health to go on a decline. I understand the fear of being alone and that you feel you may regret leaving her due to her good traits, but it’s not worth sacrificing yourself for if it’s causing so much anger and pain. she has some stuff to work on by the sounds of things and hopefully she can realise that.\n",

You can’t change anyone, you can only change the way you play a role in that persons life. Do you seriously like her very much or just don’t wanna be alone?
